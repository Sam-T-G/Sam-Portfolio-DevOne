# Project Rules

## Documentation Organization
- All Markdown (.md) files MUST be placed in the `llm-notes/` folder
- Exception: README.md in the root directory (project overview)
- Exception: LICENSE file (if in markdown format)
- This keeps documentation organized and prevents root directory clutter
- LLM notes folder is gitignored to keep repository clean
